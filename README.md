This is an interactive chart that allows users to compare the Major League Soccer club player compensations. The data is from the MLS Players Union and reflects surveys through 5/1/2013. A dropdown allows the user to compare the total compensation for each club or to look at the distribution of compensation for a specific club.

The charts were created with dimple.js and d3.js.
