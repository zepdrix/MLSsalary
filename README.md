This is an interactive chart that allows users to compare the Major League Soccer club player compensations. The data is from the MLS Players Union and reflects surveys through 5/1/2013. A dropdown allows the user to compare the total compensation for each club or to look at the distribution of compensation for a specific club.

The charts were created with dimple.js and d3.js.

## All Clubs
---
Selecting all clubs shows the total compensation for each club in the MLS in a bar graph. We can see that the LA Galaxy and the New York Red Bulls stand for above the rest of the league in terms of total compensation

## Individual Club
---
Selecting an individual club shows the compensation for each player in a bar graph as well as a graph of how each player's compensation compares to the club's total compensation. We can see that a lot of clubs, including the Columbus Crew, have a few 'superstar' players with high compensation and many players with lower compensation.
